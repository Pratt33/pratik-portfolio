# Black Hole Visualization

An interactive real-time ray-traced simulation of a Schwarzschild black hole with accurate relativistic effects and modern UI enhancements.

## ✨ Features

### 🌌 **Physics Simulation**
- **Real-time raytracing** with gravitational lensing
- **Accurate Schwarzschild geodesics** computed on GPU
- **Relativistic effects** including Doppler shift, time dilation, Lorentz contraction, aberration, and beaming

### 🎮 **Interactive Experience**
- **Responsive control panel** with collapsible sections
- **Planet simulation** with orbital mechanics
- **Quality settings** for different hardware capabilities
- **Real-time parameter adjustment**

### 🎨 **Modern Interface**
- **Clean, minimal design** with background music player
- **Attribution system** with elegant credits panel
- **Mobile-friendly** responsive layout

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
